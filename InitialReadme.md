Although it has taken me more time, my purpose with the use of script in this project is to automate the whole process from the installation of Docker by simply running the first script until the last time average of the last type of query.

This way, anyone with minimal office knowledge or even a child following the steps of this ReadMe and the scripts, could reproduce the project on their computer.

The folders are numbered in order to do all this. In each folder you will find the necessary script(s) with a short ReadMe explanation.
